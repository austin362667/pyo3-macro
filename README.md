## PyO3-macro

This project involves the development of several custom macros to transform Rust structures, generated from Protobuf Interface Definition Language (IDL), into PyO3-ready structures. The macros streamline the process, ensuring seamless integration between Rust and Python, thus enhancing the efficiency of working with Protobuf in a PyO3 environment.
